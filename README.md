### Basis

This repository has been generated from [nighthawkcoders/APCSP]([https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP), which uses the [fastai/fastpages template](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages). It heavily modifies any remaining content and deletes most excess.

### Use

This repository contains the content for the DVASS Casino site. The site provides users an entertaining card-game-playing experience, and a competitive one thanks to its leaderboard entry system. Users are invited to play the four games (Blackjack, Uno, War and Memory) for as long as they wish to achieve the best scores.

Scores on the leaderboard are based on two possible criteria. Blackjack and War are streak-based games (playing on the more luck-based nature of the games), meaning that the scores that appear on the leaderboard are based on highest streak. Uno and Memory are time-based games, so the fastest completion time is what occurs highest on the leaderboard.

#### Leaderboard Use

One quirk of the leaderboard is that your score may only be logged if it is the *only score on the leaderboard with its unique score.* This means that a high score that ties the first place score will be obsolete, and won't appear unless it beats that first place score or scores a number that hasn't yet been achieved on the leaderboard. This creates a more complex gameplay philosophy when it comes to blackjack.
