    "1. Make sure to `git pull` before making changes\n",
    "> This will make sure that you pull any changes made by your team, and prevents merge conflicts\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Make changes that are needed \n",
    "> Refer to your running site often to see changes as you develop\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Commit your changes locally\n",
    "> Do not `Sync` change from UI or `git push` from terminal yet, just `Commit`.  It is great practice to ***Commit Often*** with sensible comments.  Anytime after you commit you can pull team members changes for additional verifications.\n",

    "5. Before updating deployment start ***Docker Desktop app***  and test your Web Application.\n",

As long as Docker Desktop and Docker App is running, you can make little changes and save, they should refresh in site within a few seconds.  ***Any errors, runtime errors, will appear in browser of VSCode terminal***, read messages thoroughly and debug errors.  Docker Desktop may consume a lot of CPU resources, if you are unplugged you may want to close it after you are done testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If all goes well, `Sync` change from UI or `git push` from terminal.\n",
    "> If you can't push review `git status` from terminal.   Resolve all open files `git restore` or `git commit`, then `git pull` and repeat steps 5 to 7.\n",
