    "## Uploading content using Flask (not JavaScript) \n",
    "A common feature in web applications is to let users upload files to the server. The HTTP protocol documents the mechanism for a client to upload a file, and the Flask framework fully supports it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestion is to READ the CODE, lots of comments and start implementing.  \n",
    "See [app_content.py](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/pages_python/blob/main/contenty/app_content.py) and the hacks in the file. Note the import secure_filename from werkzeug.utils. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A Basic File Upload Form  \n",
    "See [content.html](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/pages_python/blob/main/contenty/templates/contenty/content.html).  \n",
    "From a high-level perspective, a client uploading a file is treated the same as any other form data submission. In other words, you have to define an HTML form with a file field in it.  The HTML `<input type=\"file\">` defines a file-select field and a \"Browse\" button for file uploads. \n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP multipart request is an HTTP request that HTTP clients construct to send files and data over to an HTTP Server. It is commonly used by browsers and HTTP clients to upload files to the server.  This is server side implementation and needs to be adapted for JavaScript.  \n",
    "``` \n",
    "<form id=\"upload\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" action = \"url_for('content.upload')\" method = \"POST\"> \n",
    "```\n",
    "The enctype attribute defines how the browser should format the data before it is submitted to the server.  \n",
    "multipart/form-data: This format is required when at least one of the fields in the form is a file field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refer to the files in [upload.py](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/pages_python/blob/main/uploady/app_upload.py) folder and start implementing uploads in your sponsor project."
