A database and storing persistent data is a primary focus of most backend systems.  An SQLite Database using the Python SQLAlchemy framework will be the outcome of this lesson.

    "> The ***Big Picture*** purpose of this hack is to build a database.  Being able to create an SQLite table and populate test data within it is the major goal.  To do this effectively it is imperative to show the following.\n",
    "1. Build Schema for a table, make a new `model` file and use `users.py` as an example. Start slow and simple and build up.\n",
    "2. Build an `initXXXXX()` method and use it to add preliminary/test data to the table.  Once again use users.py as an example.\n",
    "3. Make a 30-60 second video where you show a Debugging session of making new rows in the table. Use `sqlite` marketplace tools and/or sqlite3 command line tool to show success in creating table and adding data."

    "\n",
    "- Become familiar with `initUsers()`.  Observe it is called/activated from `main.py`.  This function activates after you run the `main.py` and activate the web application in the browser.  Observe that the `sqlite.db` file will appear in the volumes directory in conjunction with home screen of site appearing in browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete sqlite.db from volumes directory on your development machine.  Set `breakpoint` on initUsers() and run `main.py using debug`.  Use the step into option on the debugger and observe the creation of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.before_first_request\n",
    "def activate_job():\n",
    "    initJokes()\n",
    "    initUsers()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make your own `XXXXX.py` file under `model` directory.  Follow `users.py` and develop your own schema from the OOP code you did in last Hacks.  Follow the pattern in `users.py` to make a initXXXX() function top populate some test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `main.py`, add your initXXXX() method to `def activate_job()` function shown above.  Use this as basis of your video debugging session.  Debugging is hugely important at this level to understand your database success prior to building an API.  Building initXXXX() method, adding database records, and debugging will enable you to verify CRUD operations as you develop."
