    "\n",
    "##### Period (most teachers would find it useful to have their data divided into class periods)\n",
    "##### Scrum Team (basically, the largest overarching groups of students, under period)\n",

    "\n",
    "##### IN_PERIOD (to relate teams to the period they are in)\n",

    "##### PAIR_SHARE (relationship defining students who are paired together)\n",
