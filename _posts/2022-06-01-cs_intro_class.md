## Intro Class Logistics (Del Norte desires title by end of meeting)
> Idea is to have a course to focusses on freshman/sophomore classes. The purpose Computer Science and Software Engineering at Del Norte and PUSD, is to add to the beginning of the pathway that feeds into AP Computer Science Principles (CSP).  [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XNNVmkB1hV4Vh7V084HifSchucYB8LKiSgJA1CW9nlw/edit)
- 1st trimester course is Game Design
- 2nd trimester course is Game Design with an App Focus

## Pathway
> The Computer Science Pathway, including Trimester modifications required at Del Norte High School.

| Preferred Grade | Course | Trimesters | Credit | Notes/Experience |
| 9th or 10th | Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) | 2 | UC G | Entry to pathway |
| 10th or 11th | AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) | 2 | UC D or G| Requires CSSE or equivalent experience |
| 10th or 11th | Data Structures 1 (DS1) | 1 | DS1/DS2 articulate | Part of CSP year and contract |
| 11th or 12th | AP Computer Science A (CSA) | 2 | UC C or G | Requires CSP, DS1 or experience in Technologies taught in Del Norte program. |
| 11th or 12th | Data Structures 2 (DS2) | 1 | DS1/DS2 articulate | Part of CSA year and contract |

### Start with:
- Scratch Introduction
- Course Plans
    - Introduction to tools (e.g. IDE and Github)
    - Fundamentals in Programming in selected language (C# or Scratch)
    - Agile Development Fundamentals, Pair Programming, 

### Move on to main focus:
- [Create an Apple App using Xcode and Swift](https://www.apple.com/education/k12/learn-to-code/)
    AND/OR
- [Unity Game Development Curriculum](https://learn.unity.com/course/teaching-game-design-and-development)

## Certificate Programs
> Certificates are available online and at many avenues (Udemy, LinkedIN, Apple, etc).  Teachers could/should learn and then perhaps teach courses that are aligned to certificates by an organization like LinkedIn.  This would enable Teachers and District to confidently state that their Teachers are current to CTE advisors.
### LinkedIn Certification Programs for Development Engineering Methodology
> Skills to assist in teaching Project Based Learning.

- [Github Issues](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/github-issues-and-projects-for-teams)

- [Agile Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-an-agile-software-developer)

- [Devops Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-devops-engineer)

### LinkedIn Certificates for Programming
> Certificates to assist in teaching Intro to Programming, Computers Science Principles, Computer Science "A" development.

- [Intro Scratch](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-scratch)

- [Intro C# Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/getting-started-as-a-c-sharp-developer)

- [Intro Swift Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-swift)

- [CSP Python Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-python-developer-8969630)

- [CSP - JavaScript Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-javascript-developer)

- [CSA - Java Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-java-4)


## Accreditation, Articulation and Beyond
> In discussion on titles, it seems vital to a High School Pathway that it leads beyond.  A key contributor to increasing Del Norte student participation in Computer Science, ~100 tto ~240, is the introduction of Computer Science Principles.
- ***Computer Science Principles has AP testing and UC accreditation*** as a 3rd Science, not just elective. 
- ***Computer Science "A" has AP testing and UC accreditation*** as a 4th Math, not just elective.
- ***Data Structure 1&2 with B or above graded will articulate to CS113 Data Structures.***  There has been movement by Emily Stephenson, Del Norte and Mira Costa College regarding articulation. This begins with students taking CSP/DS1 in Fall of 2022, it completes with students finishing CSA/DSP2 in Summer of 2024, receiving credit for [CS113 â€“ Data Structures](https://catalog.miracosta.edu/disciplines/computerscience/#courseinventory).
- ***Beyond College***, it seems the other "Big Thing" that High School Computer Science can do is to prepare students for internships and jobs.  Del Norte has been placing people regularly at Northrop Grumman (2 per year), UCSD Supercomputer (2 per year), Code Ninjas (2 per year).  Additionally, I have 2 reports of students Teaching in CompSci Labs on campus (Harvard and Mira Costa College).  Lastly, I have heard of a Purdue freshmen that is currently getting a Government clearance for internship in Summer 2023.  An absolute key is having projects published on GitHub!  The Purdue freshmen said the internship interviewer said "they reviewed projects on GitHub and new that he could code". These opportunities seem to come because of Agile Methodology, Scrum, Python/Flask, Java/Spring, AWS, SQL, Linux, Anaconda, Docker, Nginx, GitHub. 

```
CS 113: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

Units: 3
Prerequisites: CS 112.
Acceptable for Credit: CSU, UC
Lecture 2 hours, laboratory 3 hours.
Course Typically Offered: Fall, Spring, and Summer
```

- The course uses topics of personal and social relevance to investigate the impact of computing through efficient algorithms and properly designed data structures. Students explore the software development process by developing effective solutions using industry-standard tools. Topics include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, object-oriented design, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs. C-ID COMP-132.
