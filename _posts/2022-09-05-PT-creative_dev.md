## Points will be awarded on these key elements

### AppLab Planning/Blogging  
> It is important that you make a plan and make note of the steps you take during this process.  Work with your partner(s) on process, but you will create your own Blog.
- Create a blogpost with an outline of your AppLab project before starting to code. 
- Add to or create a blogpost with your thinking and ideas for creating your app, this should be done individually.
- This blogpost should help remind you of successes and failures made during your designing process, so be reflective of your work.   It is better, if you show the adjustments you needed to make in the process.

### AppLab Creation 
> This point is earned for the app itself. Add links or screen captures of your created app in AppLab to your blog.
- The example app is a quiz, so the expectation is you are able to create your own quiz.  You and your partner should work together, but can have individual customizations.
- For those looking for a challenge, you can create a more involved app with your partner, testing potential ideas for your create task.

### Create Performance Task Planning/Draft
> After going through AppLab process ...  Now go through the process, with your partner, thinking about what type of App or Web Page you will create for the end of the Trimester Night at the Museum Project that meets College Board criteria.  Try applying your AppLab project design and ideas to the Create Performance Task project.
- Suggestion is to create a Jupyter notebook for design to be able to add code or markdown in design discussion.
- What are all the technical requirements for the project?  What can you design now?
- What do you need to learn to complete the Create Performance Task design process?  What resources do you have available to start on the design journey?


### Live Grading Presentation.  
> Each individual needs to perform their own AppLab work and updates.  However, we would like you to work on the design and solving problems as a pair.   On preliminary design and planning for Create Performance Task, work can be shared...
- AppLab project runs with no errors and provides score at the end.  Show all features in your app.
- AppLab project has Blog in each individuals Fastpages that points to their AppLab project and contains design work according to hack guidelines.
- Base off of AppLab project experience.  Start to Brain Storm/Idea write a Create Performance Task Planning/Draft showing initial thoughts/purpose for a project, things you know how to do, things you need to learn.  Plan to continue to use this blog to fill in future week to fill in the gaps.
- Every time requirements
    - Create Review Ticket.  Crossover grades, Crossover Comments, and Blog(s) used during week.
    - Be prepared to go fast, but show everything we should be under 5 minutes.  1 minute per person.
    - Jupyter Notebooks contain  Markdown cells with comments to support code.
