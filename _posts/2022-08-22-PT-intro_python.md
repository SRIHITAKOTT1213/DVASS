# Introduction to Python - Week 1
Introduction to Python sprint is a time to learn and obtain basic skills needed to Code a little bit.  
- Learning basics of Python
- Learning how to Check setup work using Bash
- Capturing notes and coding while building a Fastpages/GitHub pages and a yearlong individual notebook
- Establish positive PBL habits: a focused mindset in the classroom, establishing work habits to achieve success.

## Daily Plans Week 1
Discuss some concepts in [Big Idea 3 Algorithms and Programming](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=3).  Always Code/Code/Code in classroom when schedule allows!  Practice Pair Programming Habit of 30 minutes/30 minutes/1 commit each and start of "Personal Computer Plan".  Here is a resource that can help you do a [Python Overview](https://www.afterhoursprogramming.com/tutorial/python/python-overview/), though use Jupyter Notebook and VSCode instead of the suggested IDLE.  If you use this resource, try to create something that looks similar to their website; this will teach you how to design based off of what you see.
- Monday: "Live Review" with pairs: show personal progress in setting up tools with Teacher.  Doing checks with Bash Jupyter notebook.
- Tuesday: Test Prep - Discuss Anatomy of Python.  
- Wednesday: Tech Talk - Fastpages, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown	: Tour of working on _posts and _notebooks.
- Thursday: Tech Talk - Focus and Habits, video frm Yale.
- Friday: Code/Code/Code - Pair Programming in Jupyter Notebook.
