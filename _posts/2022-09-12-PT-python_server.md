- Show making a permanent change (Commit, Sync) on VSCode.
- Show GitHub change list and show delta of change on GitHub Web Page

> Live Review.  Review ticket and playing a Video.  3 Teams/Tables will observe all other members.  Approx. 12 - 1 minute videos.
- Videos should incorporate something you took away for Focus and Habits in the Review Ticket, Video, or personal Blog.  Perhaps something that shows Collaboration could get you and team toward 3 points.
- It is suggested that you Create a YouTube channel, if you don't have one.  Videos should be placed in YouTube or Google Drive. NOT in GitHub, NOT in Slack.
- Make sure you have a Team review ticket with all Video links.  The twelve people watching should have a place to comment on each individual.
- Be prepared to present fast, be quick, we think you should show everything in under 5 minutes for a Team of 4.
