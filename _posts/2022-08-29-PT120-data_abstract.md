## Points will be awarded on these three key elements

### Python Tech Talk
> It is important that you create your own InfoDb.  This must be a data capture of your own interest.  The Jupyter page should include.  There must be a pair element in the programming.
- Cell focused on InfoDb database definition.  
- Function(s) that focus on printing your InfoDb according to your data abstraction and data definition requirements
- Independent cells that show your data work with For loop, For loop with index, While Loop, and Recursion
- The page needs Markdown and Code cells. Markdown sections should describe objective and purpose at the beginning, as well as describe each of the Code cells.  Additionally, each Python cell should contain comments.
- Add a little flair for that extra appeal.  An idea, is to add Input to adding records to InfoDb (combining learnings from last lesson).  Don't show up with a straight copy, this will not be meeting expectations.

### HTML/Markdown Fragments.  
> As we are learning Lists, this week I believe it is very important for each student to build a Table.  This can be done in markdown or html.   This should have individual look, collaboration is OK, but you must have a distinct table.
- This to be something "Productive".
- This requires you to use \{\{ \}\} liquid syntax somewhere in the table.  Please make sure you comment source of this key/value.

### Live Grading Presentation.  
> Each individual needs to perform their own work and updates.  However, I would like you to work with the same InfoDB as your pair.   In presentation, consider the following...
- Each individual contains two looping algorithms in their own repository.  All four are covered between pair.
- Be sure to discuss your HTML/Markdown table and any additional flair
- Every time requirements
    - Create Comment in Blog.  Crossover grades, Crossover Comments, and Blog(s) used during week.
    - Be prepared to go fast, but show everything we should be under 5 minutes.  1 minute per person.
    - Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and Markdown cells
    - Output of Jupyter code is required
