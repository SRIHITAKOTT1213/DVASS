    - Consider using GitHub Issues to support this process.
    - Develop and describe expectations of each feature.
    - Use feature, expected outcome, and the minimal amount of code each feature.
    - Document accomplishment with tangible evidence.
    - Have feature reviews, demos, and obtain feedback (team and/or customer)
    - Update and derive new features and tasks for next step in Software Development Life Cycle
- My suggestion is this person helps with Frontend development

    - Describe use of Lists or Dictionaries, database, tables, attributes, records, and systems of access (JSON, Lists, Dictionaries).
- Comments. Be sure developers use comments in code to facilitate current and future understanding of the key portions of system.


### Hacks (Video 2).  Recommend...  Minimize talking, minimize mouse movements, and share Tangibles.
> Make a less than 4 minute video.  Each individual should talk in video, code, and make their part of the video. Consider crossing over to other tables and share methods and methodologies of those working on similar roles.
- Scrum Master should make sure all things come together.  
- DevOps should ensure there is a working project to Demo at all times.
- Everyone should complete their part(s).
- Everyone should help other Team Members when struggling.
