            "content": "(In your VSCode, run the code cell below. It will be used throughout the lesson.) . player_chips = 100 class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Introduction: Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In the card game, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. See two examples of how it can work below. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops are used throughout the Python blackjack model. This is seen with the interaction between the game_start() function and the play_again() function. . def game_start(): #after the game setup and outcome... play_again() def play_again(): if player_chips != 0: pa = input(&#39;Would you like to play again? (Input &quot;y&quot; for yes and &quot;n&quot; for no.)&#39;) if pa.lower() == &quot;y&quot;: game_start() #HERE else: return # run to see it in action game_start() . For Loops . For loops are used quite often throughout the simulation and are helpful to easily be able to repeat a set of conditions to everything inside of a list/collection of data or to repeat a process a certain number of times. . An example of both of these things are very conveniently seen in the Deck class function build(). It also shows loops being nested. . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . Going piece by piece: . for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: . Whatever is mentioned below this will be repeated four times, once for each of the listed card suits. . for val in range(2, 15) . Here, the for loop is essentially doing the same thing as before, this time with a list of numbers starting with 2 and ending with 14. As a result, the function runs 13 times, each time with a new integer value that is assigned to the value of a card of a certain suit. . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . **Student Interation**: How could this `build` function be altered to function with a **while loop** within it? . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make a variable i to be the numbers in the range # you could increment it each loop . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 49 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like randint or randrange as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? . import random s_deck = [] #to be built build(s_deck) #filling deck def select_random(deck): rando = random.randint(0, len(deck)) #generating a random number to use as index randsel = deck[rando] #selecting a random card with the index deck.pop(rando) #getting rid of the selected card from the deck return randsel.show() select_random(s_deck) . &#39;Jack of Spades&#39; . Student Interaction (Hack) . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . A random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Two different types of iteration | . # (Concert attendance? Wind speeds? Interactions between subjects in large environments?) # Think about the sort of things that could be saved in lists, dictionaries, etc. # (Even better if you can take advantage of the specific features of multiple types of data sets!) # What kind of iteration happens in the real world? # What occurs repeatedly, even over a long period of time? # Keep in mind that the simulation doesn&#39;t have to model real time. # You could, for example, model the results of a disease spreading through a population in just one second. .",

Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

            "content": "Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its first instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform specific tasks or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. | Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | An algorithm with better efficiency requires less time and resources to execute and is generally considered to be more desirable. | Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. | Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | .
